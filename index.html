      <p class="indexp1 homep">Ethical fashion is garment design, production, and distribution that focuses on reducing harm to people and the planet. It benefits those working in the supply chain and creates a better future for everyone, rather than just for those at the top. Sustainable fashion refers to clothing that is designed, manufactured, distributed, and used in ways that are environmentally friendly. This varies from buying organic materials, to the way in which one washes their clothes.</p>

      <p class="indexp3" "homep">On April 24, 2013, the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed. More than 1,100 people died and another 2,500 were injured, making it the fourth largest industrial disaster in history. This tragedy was preventable. In the aftermath, survivors told stories of how they noticed cracks in the building and knew the building was hazardous just days before the collapse. Multiple workers told their supervisors that they were afraid to enter the building and continue working. The retails shops and banks on the ground floor shut down their operations, but the demand of an insatiable fashion industry forced garment workers to keep working. The ugly truth is that some of us may have bought and wore the clothes they made.</p>

      <p class="indexp4" "homep">Fashion supply chains are highly globalised, complex and opaque. Business relationships are often very murky and subcontracting is common. This lack of transparency costs lives. The reality is that our clothes have gone on a long journey before they reach stores and webshops, passing through the hands of cotton farmers, spinners, weavers, dyers, sewers and many more. We have seen some positive change across the industry in recent years. However, human rights abuses and environmental degradation remain rife. While vast numbers of the public have become more aware of these problems, many people remain in the dark, unaware that their clothes may be contributing to the climate crisis and human exploitation. No one should die for fashion and thatâ€™s why we need a fashion revolution.</p>
