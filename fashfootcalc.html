<p class = "FFCp">Your closet and the clothes you buy can have a big impact on the environment. Doing simple things like washing garments with warm water, or buying online vs. in-store can change how harmful your environmental impact is. ThredUP will show you the effects of multiple factors related to your fashion choices, such as how many pounds of carbon dioxide your fashion choices emit and a comparison to the average, as well as how many flights it would take to emit as much carbon as you do with your wardrobe.
